# simple-web-app

This is a web application that my friend Shane helped me build. We initially worked together on his computer building it, which is why the first commit is not by him. 

This helped me to learn about Node.JS and how web apps work. I alsow was able to deploy to Heroku and see my page live, which was cool.
